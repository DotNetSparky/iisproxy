Create two sites in IIS:
	The main one (that would be an example of the "public" website), pointing to the 'iisproxy' folder as root.
	The second one is an example of the site that is being proxied (that would be available at "localhost:9000", etc.), pointing to the 'test-proxy' folder as root.
	Update app settings in the iisproxy/web.config to point to the URL of the test proxy site.
